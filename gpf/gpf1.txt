1. Introduction

   1.1. Purpose

      The purpose of this document is to inform the publicity about
      the hard- and software used at GymPeg by:

         * Providing all information we have about the hardware;

         * Providing all information we have about the software;

         * Being open about what we don't know [yet];

         * Providing contact adresses for committing information to
           this file;

         * Providing links to other documents informing you about
           exploits and tools to use to continue this project and
           reverse-engineer other schools.

      This document does not go into details about how the flaws can
      be exploited, because that's left to GPF3. Also it does not
      inform about how to mine this data, because GPF2 does that.

   1.2. Intended audience

      This information is intended for people wanting to know about
      the details of the GymPeg computer equipment. Either as a
      prequel to GPF 3 or a sequel to GPF 2.

      The text assumes a good user-level and programming computer
      knowledge. You should be familiar with Microsoft Windows,
      Mozilla Firefox and some of Debian to understand everything.

   1.3. Scope

      This document informs you about the hardware and software, it
      does not describe the software used to get this info.

   1.4. Conventions

      bit: binary (base 2) digit, usually in form of electricity
      byte: 8 bits
      Windows: The Windows series of operating systems by Microsoft
      WMI: Windows Management Interface, a database-like interface
           exposed to every Windows user

2. Hardware details

   2.1. Server next to room A.2.?

      The main server seems to be the one in the room next to room
      A.2.?. It is hooked up to a big network switch with probably all
      the thinclients in the 3 rooms plugged into. The CPU of the
      server was identified as being an Intel Xeon E5-2620 v4, which
      is an 8-core server CPU running at 2.1 to 3.0 GHz released by
      the Intel Corporation in Q1 of 2016. The RAM seems to be ~24GB
      in size according to WMI. The GPU is not known by now, because
      WMI returns "Microsoft Hyper-V-Video", which stands for the
      GPU-abstraction of Microsofts Hyper-V virtualization service
      that the server runs.

   2.2. Room A.2.?

      The room A.2.? is the computer room on the second floor, as
      indicated by the 2. This room is not special in any way, it
      contains many thin clients and a desktop computer at the front.
      The thin clients have the brand "Thinner Technology Pro
      Education" shown at the boot screen and the model name "Scholar
      500" exposed inside the Windows Embedded CE that runs on them.
      They have about 550 Megabytes of Flash storage, 500 Megahertz
      of CPU power, probably single-core, and about 450 Megabytes of
      RAM. We were not able to find the computer or company online
      [yet]. We don't know anything about the desktop [yet].

   2.3. Room A.1.25

      The room A.1.25 is the computer room on the first floor, as
      indicated by the 1. This room is not special in any way either,
      it contains many thin clients and a desktop computer at the
      front, too. The thin clients have the strings "ZBOX" and "ZOTAC"
      at the boot screen, they also look similar to the QK7P5000.
      Their operating systems seems to be openthinclient, which makes
      research really hard, because it connects to the server when you
      start it and shuts down once you disconnect from it. While this
      mechanic can be disabled by quickly pressing Ctrl and C while it
      boots you need a username and a password to log into it, which
      we do not have [yet]. We do not know anything about the server
      [yet].

   2.4. Room A.K.5

      The room A.K.5 is the computer room in the basement of the
      school, as indicated by the 'K' for German "Keller". This room
      contains many thin clients, a desktop computer and a big
      touchscreen. The thin clients run Windows Embedded 7, so exactly
      the same sandbox escape and system information exploits from
      room A.2.? are applicable. The thin clients are called
      SCHOLA-V1000VEC7 by Windows, the brand seems to be Thinner
      Technology, again. The CPU is shown to be a Nano processor by
      the company VIA Technology, the RAM seems to be 707 megabytes in
      size and the internal flash storage seems to be 488 megabytes in
      size. The exact Windows Embedded version number is shown to be
      7.0.019.
