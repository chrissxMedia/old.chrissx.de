hello...today i want to speak to you about the evolution of the means
of transport during the industrial revolution
transporting large goods -> old roads not enough anymore -> after
steam machine invented: trains & steampowered ships -> need for
railways and canals; canal-wise bridgewater canal: mainly transport
coal cheaply worsley -> manchester, 15 kilometres
early trains for transportation coal, around 1800 480 kilometres
railway soon railways for personal transport -> soon people noticed
problem w/ relative time bc. traveling times & "created" greenwich
time -> fix differences between local times in different parts of uk
middle 19th century: 25k people building railways & 50k running trains
car not invented, roads still needed, mostly horses, while roads in fe
france maintained really well over times, roads in uk really bad
condition, many toll roads set up -> pay maintaining the roads, toll
roads: roads, pay a fee -> allowed use
that was my talk about the evolution of the means of transport in the
industrial revolution, thanks for listening.
